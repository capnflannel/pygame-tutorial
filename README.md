# pygame-tutorial
Welcome! I'm exploring how to create video games in Python using Pygame!

I'll be using the following tutorial as an introductory guide: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/

All assets are either "hand-drawn" or sourced from https://opengameart.org/

# PyGame Tutorial Goals
1) The Absolute Basics
- [x] Set up and draw a fixed size window
- [x] Define the game loop
- [x] Change the background color
- [x] Draw some shapes to the window

2) Handle User Input
- [x] Get user input from keyboard
- [x] Add event handling
- [x] Dynamically update screen based on user input
- [x] Exit the game loop based on user input

3) Sprites and Movement
- [x] Draw a sprite to the screen
- [x] Move the sprite around based on user input

4) Interaction
- [x] Add more objects to the screen
- [x] Interact with objects on screen
- [x] Collision detection and handling

5) Importing Assets
- [x] Use art assets in place of simple "hand-drawn" sprites

6) Timing
- [x] Adjust game clock to set desired framerate

7) Sound
- [x] Import sound assets and tie to specific events

8) Refactor
- [ ] Refactor the game to better learn Python and use proper coding practices

9) Customize
- [x] Add score keeping
- [x] Fix collision hitboxes
- [ ] Add restart after death
- [ ] Add intro
- [ ] Add start menu
- [x] Add pause menu
- [ ] Add options menu
- [ ] Add selectable difficulty
- [ ] Add non-linear pathing of projectiles
- [x] Add shooting mechanism
- [x] Add player health
- [x] Add power-ups
- [ ] Add animations (e.g. explosions)
- [ ] Add experience (leveling)
- [ ] Add shields

TODO: Discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and any lessons learned.
