# pygame-tutorial
Welcome! I'm exploring how to create video games in Python using Pygame!

I'll be using the following tutorial as an introductory guide: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/

All assets are either "hand-drwan" or sourced from https://opengameart.org/

# PyGame Tutorial Goals
1) The Absolute Basics
- [x] Set up and draw a fixed size window
- [x] Define the game loop
- [x] Change the background color
- [x] Draw some shapes to the window

2) Handle User Input
- [x] Get user input from keyboard
- [x] Add event handling
- [x] Dynamically update screen based on user input
- [x] Exit the game loop based on user input

3) Sprites and Movement
- [ ] Draw a sprite to the screen
- [ ] Move the sprite around based on user input

4) Interaction
- [ ] Add more objects to the screen
- [ ] Interact with objects on screen
- [ ] Collision detection and handling

5) Importing Assets
- [ ] Use art assets in place of simple "hand-drawn" sprites
- [ ] Import a background image

6) Timing
- [ ] Adjust game clock to set desired framerate

7) Sound
- [ ] Import sound assets and tie to specific events

8) Refactor
- [ ] Refactor the game to better learn Python and use proper coding practices

9) Customize
- [ ] Add a custom feature to the game!
